AS PER THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN, ONLY HTML CSS AND JAVASCRIPT IS USED. NO JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORK OR CSS FRAMEWORK OR ANY LIBRARY WAS USED IN THIS PROJECT. ALSO TO MAKE IT RESPONSIVE, I HAVE USED MEDIA QUERIES.
THAT'S ALL.

This is a static candidate page of Lueinhire.com. When I first saw the official page, the first thing that I wanted to do was redesigning the navbar. So, considering the logo of the website, I chose to design the whole website with similar theme color.
The whole website is designed in the same theme using different shades of the same color. Although I have not linked different pages in the navbar so we won't be able to check the active class.
but just to showcase the same, I have added the active class manually to the candidate page, also I have written the javascript code for the active class for the same, just in case.

I believe that a professional website is supposed to be a minimal and simple one. And the contet that i was able to fetch from the official website was limited, so, there are just a few tweaks that I have made and it looks good, minimal, attractive and professional.

Considering the fact that it is a candidate page, minor animations using hover effect on the buttons do a great job. I personally think that they are amazing like that.

Hamburger is just a normal menu but in the same color scheme.

Coming to the footer of the website. I made a few changes. The social media icons are made in the same way as the color scheme of the website. The circle shape makes it more eye catchy.

THE WEBSITE IS FULLY RESPONSIVE FOR ALL THE DEVICES.

EVERYTHING ON THIS PAGE IS DESIGNED MY ME. MADE THIS WITHOUT ANY PAGE REFERENCES. THIS IS ALL ME. THIS IS WHAT I VISUALISED IN MY HEAD.
AND I WAS ABLE TO CODE THE SAME.

THANK YOU!!
